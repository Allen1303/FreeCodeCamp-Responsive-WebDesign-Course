## Learning Objectives for Beginners
While working on this project, beginners can learn and practice the following HTML concepts:

- Creating HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, - lists, forms, and fieldsets.
- Using attributes like id, type, name, value, checked, and for.
- Nesting HTML elements for proper structure.
- Understanding the purpose of a legend element in a fieldset.
- Implementing radio buttons and checkboxes within a form.
- Creating anchors for links and embedding images.
